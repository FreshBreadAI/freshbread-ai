# Homepage Roast App v2.4

This is the latest version of the Homepage Roast application with enhanced loading UI featuring:

- Sequential loading messages with emojis
- Fading animations for active loading steps
- Checkmarks that appear after each step completes
- A progress bar that advances from 0-100%
- Improved container width to prevent line breaks in status messages
- Fixed text spacing between message content and checkmarks

## GitHub Deployment Instructions

1. Create a repository named `freshbread-ai` if you don't already have one
2. Make sure your local copy is properly set up with your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/FreshBreadAI/freshbread-ai.git
   ```
3. Push this entire directory to the `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git add homepage-roast-app30-04-2025-2.4
   git commit -m "Add Homepage Roast App v2.4 with enhanced loading UI"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Webflow Integration

1. Copy the entire contents of `webflow-index.html` 
2. In Webflow, add an HTML embed element to your page
3. Paste the copied code into the embed element
4. Save and publish your Webflow site

The app references these CDN URLs:
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/FreshBreadAI/freshbread-ai@main/homepage-roast-app30-04-2025-2.4/
```

## Local Testing

You can test the application locally without GitHub by:

1. Opening `standalone-test.html` directly in your browser
2. This test file contains buttons to simulate different loading scenarios:
   - "Test Success (5s)" - Simulates a successful analysis completion after 5 seconds
   - "Test Error" - Simulates an error during analysis
   - "Test Long Loading (70s)" - Tests what happens when loading takes longer than expected

## File Structure

- `index.html` - Main application HTML
- `webflow-index.html` - Embed code for Webflow with CDN references
- `standalone-test.html` - Self-contained test file
- `css/style.css` - CSS for styling the application
- `js/` - JavaScript files:
  - `config.js` - Configuration parameters
  - `api.js` - API interaction code
  - `ui.js` - User interface code with enhanced loading
  - `main.js` - Main application logic

## Troubleshooting

If the app doesn't load after GitHub deployment:
1. Make sure your repository name and branch match the CDN URLs in `webflow-index.html`
2. Check that all files have been pushed to GitHub in the correct directory structure
3. Wait a few minutes for GitHub and jsDelivr CDN to sync
4. Clear your browser cache or try in a private/incognito window

## Feature Flag

If you encounter any issues with the enhanced loading UI, you can disable it by setting:
```javascript
const ENABLE_ENHANCED_LOADING = false;
```
in `js/ui.js`, which will revert to the original spinner UI.
